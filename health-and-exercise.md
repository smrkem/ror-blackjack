## Health and Exercise

Want to determine what a decent amount of exercise is for
- a man my age
- a man my weight

Heart Rate
- can make a 1page serverless app for 'measuring' heart rate (pulse * 15 seconds).

First determine maximum heart rate:
`= 208 - (age * 0.7)`


AHA Suggests:
- 150min moderate activity / week
- 75min vigorous activity / week

CDC Describes:

| activity | heart rate   |
|----------|--------------|
| moderate | 50 - 75% max |
| vigorous | 70 - 85% max |
